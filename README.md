# AdventOfCode2024

First time doing AoC. Won't be competing, just for practice.
All attempts are my own and answers are only viewed after solving myself.
The goal is to improve on understanding of algorithms and engage with AoC community.
As I get deeper into the challenge I'm trying to rely less on brute force.
Started on day 9 so I have some catching up to do.
